1. A link to the paper (or set of papers) you are trying to reproduce.
    
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00002

1. A literature search and a codebase search. Basically links to ANYTHING you think might be helpful to reproducing the work.

    https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow

1. A review of the paper you are reproducing, following the guidelines laid out here: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8787-a-step-toward-quantifying-independently-reproducible-machine-learning-research.pdf 
    - Number of Tables              : 1
    - Number of Graphs/Plots        : 0
    - Number of Equations           : 12
    - Number of Proofs              :  N/A (I'm not sure "proof" can be in machine learning papers, good accuracy?)
    - Exact Compute Specified   : Yes
    - Hyper-parameters Specified    : Yes (Not included in the paper, but listed in config on Github repository)
    - Compute Needed    : Yes
    - Data Available    : Yes
    - Pseudo Code       : No, but real code is provided
    - Number of Conceptualization Figures   : 1
    - Uses Exemplar Toy Problem : No
    - Number of Other Figures   : 0
    - Rigor vs Empirical    :   Empirical(?)
    - Paper Readability     :   Text part is easily readable, but difficult for me to understand equations...
    - Algorithm Difficulty  :   Difficult to understand equations, not much explanation, but maybe we can look at the code
    - Primary Topic         :   ??
    - Looks Intimidating    :   For me, yes.  But the github repository looks friendly...
    
    - The evaluation of audio quality was done using Amazon Mechanical Turk (we won't be able to do the same...)
        
1. A proposed timeline for reproducing the project. Should be milestones for each week for the rest of the quarter. That way we can see if you're on track.
    
    | Week | Plan | Actual |
    ----|----|---- |
    | ~ April 22 | - Read the paper roughly | ... |
    | ~ April 29 | - Understand the paper <br>  - Get the code from NVIDIA's repository and make it work with a pre-trained model <br> - List questions to ask during the meeting| ... |
    | ~ May 6 | - Train the model from scratch | ... |
    | ~ May 13 | - Train the model from scratch <br>  - Decide agenda for a presentation and get reviewed | ... |
    | ~ May 20 | - Train the model from scratch and evaluate it <br>  - Create a presentation material and get reviewed | ... |
    | ~ May 27 | - Modify the presentation material <br>  - Deliver a presentation | ... |
    | ~ June 3  | - Need to check if there's a final report or anything... | ... |
