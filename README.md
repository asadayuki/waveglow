1. A review of the paper you are reproducing, following the guidelines laid out here: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8787-a-step-toward-quantifying-independently-reproducible-machine-learning-research.pdf (Links to an external site.)

1. A proposed timeline for reproducing the project. Should be milestones for each week for the rest of the quarter. That way we can see if you're on track.
